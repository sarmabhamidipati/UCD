Functions with multiple parameters

    Modify the function header such that it accepts two parameters, word1 and word2, in that order.
    Concatenate each of word1 and word2 with '!!!' and assign to shout1 and shout2, respectively.
    Concatenate shout1 and shout2 together, in that order, and assign to new_shout.
    Pass the strings 'congratulations' and 'you', in that order, to a call to shout(). Assign the return value to yell.
