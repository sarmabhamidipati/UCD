Instructions

    In the filter() call, pass a lambda function and the sequence of tweets as strings, tweets_df['text'].
    The lambda function should check if the first 2 characters in a tweet x are 'RT'. Assign the resulting filter object to result.
    To get the first 2 characters in a tweet x, use x[0:2]. To check equality, use a Boolean filter with ==.
    Convert result to a list and print out the list.
    To help you accomplish this, the Twitter data has been imported into the DataFrame, tweets_df. Go for it!

'''
# Select retweets from the Twitter DataFrame: result
result = filter(lambda x:x[0:2]=='RT', tweets_df['text'])

# Create list from filter object result: res_list
res_list = list(result)

# Print all retweets in res_list
for tweet in res_list:
    print(tweet)
