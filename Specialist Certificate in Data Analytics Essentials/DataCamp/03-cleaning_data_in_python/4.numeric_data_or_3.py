"""
In this exercise, and throughout this chapter, you'll be working with bicycle ride sharing data in
San Francisco called ride_sharing. It contains information on the start and end stations, the trip duration,
and some user information for a bike sharing service.

The user_type column contains information on whether a user is taking a free ride and takes on the following values:

    1 for free riders.
    2 for pay per ride.
    3 for monthly subscribers.

In this instance, you will print the information of ride_sharing using .info() and see a
firsthand example of how an incorrect data type can flaw your analysis of the dataset.
The pandas package is imported as pd.

Instructions 3/3

Convert user_type into categorical by assigning it the 'category' data type and store it in the user_type_cat column.
Make sure you converted user_type_cat correctly by using an assert statement.

import pandas as pd

ride_sharing = pd.read_csv('ride_sharing.csv')
# Print the information of ride_sharing
print(ride_sharing.info())

# Print summary statistics of user_type column
print(ride_sharing['user_type'].describe())

# Convert user_type from integer to category
ride_sharing['user_type_cat'] = ride_sharing['user_type'].astype('category')

# Write an assert statement confirming the change
assert ride_sharing['user_type_cat'].dtype == 'category'

# Print new summary statistics
print(ride_sharing['user_type_cat'].describe())
