Throughout the course so far, you've been exposed to some common problems that you may encounter with your data,
from data type constraints, data range constrains, uniqueness constraints,
and now membership constraints for categorical values.

In this exercise, you will map hypothetical problems to their respective categories.
Instructions

    Map the data problem observed with the correct type of data problem.
