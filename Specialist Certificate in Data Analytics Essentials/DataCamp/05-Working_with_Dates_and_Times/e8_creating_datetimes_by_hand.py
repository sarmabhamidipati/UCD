These come from the bikeshare data set that you'll use throughout the rest of the chapter.

    Import the datetime class.
    Create a datetime for October 1, 2017 at 15:26:26.
    Print the results in ISO format.

    Import the datetime class.
    Create a datetime for December 31, 2017 at 15:19:13.
    Print the results in ISO format.

    Create a new datetime by replacing the year in dt with 1917 (instead of 2017)
