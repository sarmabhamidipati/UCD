"""
Computing the ECDF
Define a function with the signature ecdf(data). Within the function definition,

    Compute the number of data points, n, using the len() function.
    The x-values are the sorted data. Use the np.sort() function to perform the sorting.
The y data of the ECDF go from 1/n to 1 in equally spaced increments. You can construct this using np.arange().
Remember, however, that the end value in np.arange() is not inclusive.
Therefore, np.arange() will need to go from 1 to n+1. Be sure to divide this by n.
The function returns the values x and y.
