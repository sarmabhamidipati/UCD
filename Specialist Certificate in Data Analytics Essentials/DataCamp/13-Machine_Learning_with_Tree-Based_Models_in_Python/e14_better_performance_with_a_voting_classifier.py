Better performance with a Voting Classifier
Finally, you'll evaluate the performance of a voting classifier that takes the outputs of the models defined in
the list classifiers and assigns labels by majority voting.

X_train, X_test,y_train, y_test, the list classifiers defined in a previous exercise, as well as the function
accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics are available in your workspace.
