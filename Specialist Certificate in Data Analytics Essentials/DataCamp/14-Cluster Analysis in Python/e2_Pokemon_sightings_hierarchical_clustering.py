Pok√©mon sightings: hierarchical clustering
In this exercise, you will form two clusters of the sightings using hierarchical clustering.

'x' and 'y' are columns of X and Y coordinates of the locations of sightings, stored in a Pandas data frame, df.
The following are available for use: matplotlib.pyplot as plt, seaborn as sns, and pandas as pd.


    Import the linkage and fcluster libraries.
    Use the linkage() function to compute distances using the ward method.
    Generate cluster labels for each data point with two clusters using the fcluster() function.
    Plot the points with seaborn and assign a different color to each cluster.
